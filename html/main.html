                                                he's losing weight, without getting thinner, and the scales register the same when he is in his clothes or out of them,
                                                however heavy they are.
                                                Scott also has new neighbours, who have opened a 'fine dining experience' in town,
                                                although it's an experience being shunned by the locals; Deidre McComb and her wife Missy Donaldson don't exactly fit in
                                                with the community's expectations. And now Scott seems trapped in a feud with the couple over their dogs dropping their
                                                business on his lawn. Missy may be friendly, but Deidre is cold as ice.
                                                As the town prepares for its annual Thanksgiving 12k run, Scott starts to understand the prejudices his neighbours face
                                                and he tries to help. Unlikely alliances form and the mystery of Scott's affliction brings out the best in people who have
                                                indulged the worst in themselves and others. `

                                                - she's infiltrated the Academy to complete a mission, one that threatens the security of everyone there. But if anyone finds out who she really is,
                                                it'll be her life on the line.
                                
                                                These cadets will have to put their differences aside and become a team to defend their world from a cunning enemy

                                                And it can only be found on a single planet: the inhospitable desert world Arrakis.

                                                When the Emperor transfers stewardship of Arrakis from the noble House Harkonnen to House Atreides,

                                                who control Arrakis' second great resource: the giant worms that burrow beneath the burning desert sands.
